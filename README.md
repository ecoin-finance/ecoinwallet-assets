# ECOIN Wallet Assets Info
## Overview

ECOIN Wallet token repository is a comprehensive, up-to-date collection of information about several thousands (!) of crypto tokens.

[ECOIN Wallet](https://ecoinwallet.org) uses token logos from this source, alongside a number of other projects.

The repository contains token info from several blockchains, info on dApps, staking validators, etc.
For every token, a logo and optional additional information are available (such data is not available on-chain).

Such a large collection can be maintained only through a community effort, so _feel free to add your token_.
